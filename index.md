# [](#header-1)About me

I like to think about systems. I have a childlike fascination and curiosity
for all phenomena. I find few tasks as rewarding as helping those around me.
If I'm not smiling or laughing, I'm deeply in thought. ;)

I practice [ataraxia][ataraxia-wiki]. It is hard to budge my equanimity.

## Outside of work

- hiking
- climbing
- guitar/piano
- home hunting
- reading textbooks / auditing courses
- dancing (fusion, pas de deux, blues, swing, waltz, lindy, bachata, kizomba)

(Listed in a very particular order: ascending string length.)

# [](#header-1) Systems

Systems are everywhere. Fundamentally, software engineering is the creation,
understanding, and modification of formal systems. However, systems also
manifest themselves in far more ordinary cases. Take for example, motes of
dust floating in a sunbeam. This is an equally fascinating, elegant, and 
complex system to study.
