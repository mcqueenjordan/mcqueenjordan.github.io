# [](#header-1)About me

I like to think about systems. Systems are everywhere. Fundamentally, software engineering is the creation, understanding, and modification of formal systems.

## Outside of work

- hiking
- climbing
- guitar/piano
- house-hunting
- reading textbooks
- dancing (swing, fusion, blues, waltz, contra, lindy)

(Listed in a very particular order: ascending string length.)
