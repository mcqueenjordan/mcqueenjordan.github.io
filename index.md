# [](#header-1)About me

- bringing others up
- [systems thinking][symsys-stanford]
- [ataraxia][ataraxia-wiki]
- hiking, bouldering, karate
- guitar ([check out my guitar][my-guitar])
- house-hunting
- working on side projects
- reading textbooks, auditing courses
- dancing (fusion, pas de deux, blues, swing, waltz, lindy, bachata, kizomba)


As far as I can tell, every observable event is worth some amount of
fascination. Our world is way too interesting to ever be bored by it.
Take an effort to bring those around you up: elevate their understanding,
their spirits, and their resolve.
