# [](#header-1)About me

I like to think about systems. I have a childlike fascination and curiosity
for all phenomena. It is an impossible task to unbalance my equanimity. I
believe that there is something to be learned from every experience. I find
few tasks as rewarding as helping those around me. I am an empiricist, but I
let my intuition tell me where to look for the evidence. If I'm not smiling or
laughing, I'm deeply in thought. ;)


## Outside of work

- hiking
- climbing
- guitar/piano
- house-hunting
- reading textbooks
- dancing (swing, fusion, blues, waltz, contra, lindy)

(Listed in a very particular order: ascending string length.)

# [](#header-1) Systems

Systems are everywhere. Fundamentally, software engineering is the creation,
understanding, and modification of formal systems. However, systems also
manifest themselves in far more ordinary cases. Take for example, motes of
dust floating in a sunbeam. This is an equally fascinating, elegant, and 
complex system to study.
