# Now

## A up-to-date blurb on my current status
*(Last modified 2017-10-06)*

---

I am currently a Software Development Engineer at [AWS][aws]. I live in
Seattle, WA, in the neighborhood of Capitol Hill. I'm currently
obsessing over engineering excellence and I'm passionately pursuing
self-growth.

I'm planning a vacation and the top of my current list of candidate
locations is Singapore. If you're interested, let me know!
