## A up-to-date blurb on my current status
*(Last modified 2018-01-02)*

I am currently a Software Development Engineer at [AWS][aws]. I live in
[Seattle, WA][seattle], in the neighborhood of [Capitol Hill][capitol-hill].
I'm obsessing over engineering excellence and passionately pursuing
self-growth.

I'm planning several vacations. Here's where I'm planning to go soon:

- [Japan][japan] &mdash; [Kyoto][kyoto], [Hokkaido][hokkaido], [Kyushu][kyushu]
- The Swiss, French, and Italian Alps

Right now I'm excited about the idea of group travel. I'm hoping to put some
"friend vacations" together. Let me know  if you're interested.
