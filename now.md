## A up-to-date blurb on my current status
*(Last modified 2017-10-06)*

I am currently a Software Development Engineer at [AWS][aws]. I live in
[Seattle, WA][seattle], in the neighborhood of [Capitol Hill][capitol-hill].
I'm obsessing over engineering excellence and passionately pursuing
self-growth.

I'm planning a vacation and the top of my current list of candidate
locations is [Singapore][singapore]. If you're interested, let me know!
