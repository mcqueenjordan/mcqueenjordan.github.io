A home is something personal, a space that can shape your habits, emotions, and
thoughts. I do not see it as overly materialistic to dream of an ideal place to
call home.

## My wishlist

- Eastern light (I wake best by natural light)
- Western light (sunsets are romantic)
- In Seattle, preferably Capitol Hill, Queen Anne, Montlake
- Ceiling-to-floor windows, and plenty of them
- Grand views of mountains and water
- High ceilings
- Open floor plan, without needless walls or partitioning elements
- A modest and easily maintainable yard
- A spacious, open kitchen that allows for entertaining while cooking
- Relatively medium-to-small house &mdash; 3br, less than 2500ft²
- Stone exterior
- Sitting high above the road
- Nearby or adjacent to green space
- Minimalism over complicated or noisy designs
- Some styles I like: Tudor, Mid-Century Modern, Gothic, Craftsman, Pacfic Lodge
- Understated or modest from the exterior &mdash; I don't want it to be showy
