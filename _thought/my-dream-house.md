My perfect house will probably cost me at least 10 years of my compensation.
You may think it is overly materialistic to dream of a house like this. I
disagree. A home is something _personal_, a space that can shape your habits,
emotions, and thoughts. I see it as an opportunity to improve my quality of
life.

## My wishlist

- Eastern light (I wake best by natural light)
- Western light (sunsets are romantic)
- In Seattle, preferably Capitol Hill, Phinney Ridge, or Ballard neighborhoods
- Ceiling-to-floor windows, and plenty of them
- Grand views of mountains and/or water, preferably both (e.g. Puget Sound +
Olympics)
- High ceilings
- Open floor plan, without needless walls or partitioning elements
- A modest and maintainable yard
- A spacious, open kitchen that allows for group cooking
- Relatively medium-to-small house &mdash; 3br, less than 2500ftÂ²
- Some stone exterior
- Sit high above the road, ideally
- Preferably single story (rambler)
- Nearby or adjacent to green space
- Minimalism beats complicated and noisy design
- Some styles I like: Tudor, Mid-Century Modern, Gothic, Craftsman, Pacfic Lodge
- Understated or modest from the exterior &mdash; I don't want it to be showy

## Examples of homes I like

- [Maple Leaf Mid-Century Modern w/ neo-Northwest motif][maple-leaf-house]
- [Sunset Hill Tudor][sunset-hill-tudor]
- [The Capitol Hill Brownstone][capitol-hill-brownstone], if it were less
gaudy on the inside, a fifth of the square footage, and an eighth of the cost
