This video is pretty cool. It gives a visual and auditory insight into sorting
algorithms. I believe this offers a unique angle that bolsters our intuitive 
understanding of how different methods of sorting work.

I strongly prefer and seek out deeper, more intuitive understandings as opposed
to shallow, rote ones. Take a look.
