[Perfect is the enemy of good][wiki]. Shipping something something imperfect is
usually better than shipping nothing at all. ([There are
exceptions][right-stuff], but they aren't common.)

Most sufficiently advanced systems have to evolve to become good. Evolution
requires exposure and experience in the real world, battle-tested behavior, and
importantly, failures. The only path to this kind of evolution is to actually
put something out there, even if it isn't perfect. *Especially if it isn't
perfect.*

The elbow in the curve of time spent improving design and analysis comes earlier
than you think. You should be spending less time designing, and more time
learning from your failures, missteps, and the complex realities of your system
in the wild. Your designs are wrong anyway. [Natural
selection][natural-selection] is going to be a far more efficient process for
showing you why and how your design is wrong than anything else.

Of note, [an old essay][worse-is-better] by Richard P. Gabriel.
