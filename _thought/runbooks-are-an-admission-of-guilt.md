I have never written a [runbook][]. And I refuse to ever do so.

Writing a runbook is a deliberate declaration of failure. It is the explicit
process that recites a refusal to correct an error. *[An error doesn't become
a mistake until you refuse to correct it.](/thought/an-error-is-not-a-mistake)*

If your organization has runbooks, consider them as backlog tasks:
automation, redesign, and architecture improvements. Do not add to their
numbers. Failure begets runbooks; runbooks beget runbooks; and runbooks beget
failure.
