It is not enough to create your own success; you must create a *shared success*.
A *talented* engineer will build a taller boat to see further along the horizon.
A *great* engineer will create a [rising tide that lifts all boats][tide].

A shared success is not limited in scope to your team &mdash; it transcends
teams. Find ways to drive shared successes across your org and company. Find
the [common good][common-good] in a solution &mdash; the positive
incentivization scheme that drives collaboration towards a shared goal. Express
that common good persuasively and collaborate to achieve a shared success.
