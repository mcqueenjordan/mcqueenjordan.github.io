[Keep Your Identity Small (2009)][essay] is an essay by Paul Graham which
describes something I've intuitively practiced since my early twenties.

My set of [justified true beliefs][jtb] come not as an expression or extension
of my identity, but from reasoned logic combined with a set of morals, ideal
outcomes, and other justified true beliefs.

A related idea is that of [“Strong Opinons, Weakly Held"][sowh], a framework
for thinking espoused by Palo Alto's Institute for the Future. The idea is that
opinions should be "weakly held" &mdash; be unattached to the idea, so that
you do not irrationaly reject its refutation. The other side of this coin is
that you must not let this lack of attachment dampen your rigor, passion, or
strength in forming, understanding, and justifying your beliefs.
