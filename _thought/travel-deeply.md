Travel should be challenging. It should change the way you think and feel. It
isn't about checking the boxes or seeing the sights. It disappoints me to have
to say: It's also not about *being seen* at those sights. The obtuse
misappropriation of the art of photography, to travel somewhere &mdash; with its
own culture, nature, and context &mdash; and make *yourself* the primary object
of your photos: [Fremdscham][] is the only word I can muster.

> Travel slowly, explore deeply

Go somewhere you don't understand. Take the time, absorb what it offers. Learn
something about the place. Learn something about yourself.
