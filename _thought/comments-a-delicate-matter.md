> A delicate matter, requiring taste and judgement.  I tend to err on the side
> of eliminating comments, for several reasons.  First, if the code is clear,
> and uses good type names and variable names, it should explain itself.
> Second, comments aren't checked by the compiler, so there is no guarantee
> they're right, especially after the code is modified.  A misleading comment
> can be very confusing.  Third, the issue of typography: comments clutter code.
