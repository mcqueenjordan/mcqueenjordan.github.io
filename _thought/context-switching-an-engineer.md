Every time you ask an engineer to work on something, you've done the equivalent
of grabbing at least $500 from your company's piggy bank and flushing it down
the toilet. You'd better make sure that new task is worth it.

Furthermore, any progress the engineer has made on the previous task, you can
now kiss goodbye. You should consider that previous task as completely
unbegun.

Context switching is incredibly expensive for engineers. It can take upwards of
an hour to simply build state on a problem &mdash; to just get to a mental
state where productive work is even feasible.
