If you like imaginative/challenging math/logic/CS problems, take a gander at
[FiveThirtyEight's The Riddler](https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/the-riddler/).

FiveThirtyEight is [Nate Silver's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nate_Silver)
website that does precise, academic, and statistical commentary on a variety
of issues. Their `The Riddler` column features hard and interesting problems
on a weekly cadence.

In the past, I have solved several, with [at least one of my solutions](
https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/will-the-baby-walk-away-will-the-troll-kill-the-dwarves/)
being featured with a shout-out. [My solution with code is on GitHub](
https://github.com/mcqueenjordan/learning/tree/master/coding-challenges/python/five-thirty-eight-riddler/domestic-boundaries).
This particular problem was a fun little geometry problem which I opted to
solve via simulation and numerical geometry, though others found an elegant
analytical solution.
