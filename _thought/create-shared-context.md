Shape the understanding and thinking of those around you to a *shared context*.
Tailor the message to the audience. Engineers, managers, product managers,
directors: To each of these people, the message must be presented in a
different light. For some, only some of the message is relevant. For others,
it is a matter of making the message comprehensible. Without a shared context,
you will inspire very few &mdash; and even fewer will create a
[shared success][shared-success] with you.
