When you become stuck on a problem, you **must** *try* for another ~15 minutes,
and then you **must** **ask**. Document what you try. It becomes a guide that
may lead you to the answer, and if not, it will certainly lead to a better
question.

The temptation to immediately ask an expert is tantalizing &mdash; but resist!
If you first try, then ask, you gain things: Trust, Knowledge, and Skill.

**Trust**, because the experts see that you've tried, and you have documents showing
what you've tried. You'll also earn trust from questions unasked &mdash; others
will discover what you've solved without help.

**Knowledge**, because some of the time in that ~15 minute buffer, you will find
the answer yourself. Knowledge gained by trial can often be stronger than
knowledge from tutelage. Sometimes, you will even learn something that no one
else knows. This is one of the greatest feelings. And frequently incredibly
fruitful.

**Skill**, because you will learn how to better learn. You will learn other
things that you weren't trying to. The 15 minute buffer might get smaller and
smaller until it's only a matter of a few minutes.

After all, an expert earns their place by trying a lot. Any sufficiently
advanced form of expertise should look similar to trying a lot &mdash; and
failing a lot. The best experts become intimate with this feeling. They may even
revel in it. Accept the discomfort, learn to embrace it, and good things follow.
