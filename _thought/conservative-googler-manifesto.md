[Yonatan's response](yonatan-essay) to the recently leaked conservative
manifesto that was circulated in Google much mirrors my own thoughts
on the matter. Google ought to come down hard on this guy.

[Tolerance is not a moral precept](tolerance-essay). There comes a point
where tolerance turns from convenience to complicity. Do the right thing.
