[Yonatan's response][yonatan-essay] to the recently leaked conservative
manifesto that was circulated in Google much mirrors my own thoughts
on the matter. Google ought to come down hard on this guy.

[Tolerance is not a moral precept][tolerance-essay]. There comes a point
where tolerance turns from convenience to complicity. Do the right thing.
