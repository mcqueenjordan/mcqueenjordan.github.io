You will always be pressured to not invest in good architecture. (To be clear,
`good architecture` isn't a real thing &mdash; there's just varying degrees of
bad architecture.) Everything is somehow flawed, but at a certain scale, it's
worth investing time to make it _less flawed._

This quote is all about shutting down the arguments you'll get along the lines
of "we can't afford to invest any time to make the architecture solid because
it will take so long." If your product survives, it will always cost you more
down the line to fix that bad architecture.

This line of reasoning, however,
can be valid in the case of an extremely early stage startup, wherein you are
trying to create MVPs and you expect your available resources to vastly
increase in a short period of time.
