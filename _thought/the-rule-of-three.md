Kudos to a previous manager of mine, [Murali Krishnan][murali-linkedin], whom
I met while working at [Transform][transform-website] for demonstrating true
mastery over the [rule of three][rule-of-three-wiki] and opening my eyes to its
power.

The `rule of three` (of which there is so much written that it
[needs a disambiguation page][disambiguation-wiki]) is an incredibly potent
tool to communicate ideas, persuade others, and to tell stories.

1. A threefold model lends explanatory power to difficult-to-explain topics,
simplifying the conceptual model and providing and elegant framework to teach.
2. Problems often cleanly subdivide into three sub-problems.
3. The cadence and presentation of threes tend to be inherently agreeable to
humans, augmenting credibility and persuasiveness.
