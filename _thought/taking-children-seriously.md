[This essay][taking-children-seriously] corroborates a lot of my own views
about how I would choose to raise my children. Whenever interacting with
children, I prefer to treat them exactly as I do adults, respecting their
ability to reason, learn, and comprehend.

As a kid, I resented being treated like a child. I didn't like it if an adult
would dumb down a concept or hand wave something away because it was assumed
I wouldn't be able to understand. I think if we treated kids more like adults,
the adults of tomorrow would be smarter and stronger.
