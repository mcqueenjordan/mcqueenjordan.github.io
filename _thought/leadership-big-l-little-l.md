I recently attended an Ada Talk at work. (Here at AWS, Ada is a group whose
motivation is to create a community to empower, grow, and develop our women
engineers.) One of the panelists, Clare Liguori, spoke about
`Big L, Little l leadership`.

`Big L Leadership` is official. It's the managers, directors and executives of
the world. `Little l leadership` is leading by example. It's camaraderie,
teamwork, and excellence of character. Engineers have a lot of opportunity for
`little l leadership`. Take advantage of that. Be a `little leader`.
