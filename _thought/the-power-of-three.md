While working at [Transform][transform-website], my manager/mentor [Murali
Krishnan][murali-linkedin] demonstrated true mastery over the [rule of three]
[rule-of-three-wiki].

I want to write about how he employed this `rule of three` (of which there is
so much written that it [needs a disambiguation page][disambiguation-wiki])
because it was evident that it was an extremely potent method that served
several ends:

1. It lends extraordinary explanatory power to otherwise difficult-to-explain
topics.
2. It nicely breaks problems into sub-problems. (Three is a good number of
subproblems to have.)
3. It had an intrinsic elegance &mdash; and was a powerful technique to
influence the thinking of others.
