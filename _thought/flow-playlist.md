[Flow][flow-playlist-link] is my playlist for concentration, coding, problem
solving, etc. I long searched for the perfect playlist to listen to as I worked,
but after being unable to find it I created it myself.

Its aim is to optimize for [the mental state of Flow][flow-wiki]. Using nearly
exclusively non-vocal tracks, the genres are primarily [spacemusic][space] and
[ambient][ambient], whose tempo and sound-stage I find optimizes well for flow.
