I long searched for the perfect playlist to listen to as I worked. I never
found it. So I tried to create it.

[Flow][flow-playlist-link] is my playlist for concentration, coding, problem
solving, etc. As of Mar 2019, it has over 57 hours of music.

Its aim is to optimize for [the mental state of Flow][flow-wiki]. Using nearly
exclusively non-vocal tracks, the genres are primarily [spacemusic][space] and
[ambient][ambient].
