![Titanium Key Chain](/assets/images/titanium-key-chain.jpg)

I love to hack the everyday. I don't like the status-quo of accepting inadequate
tools. A key ring is something you use everyday, but its usability sorely lacks.
Why settle for a bad design and annoying usability when you can buy a key ring
that's incredibly well-engineered, with ease of use, made out of bulletproof
buy-it-for-life materials?

This has been my key chain for years: [KNOX Titanium Custom Split Key
Chain][amzn]. When I can replace something that I use everyday with something
twice as good that will last forever, I do it immediately.

I actually think this is going to be more cost-effective in the long run, too.
You will never replace this key chain. It's aircraft-grade titanium. This is a
perfect example of [the boots theory of economics][boots].
