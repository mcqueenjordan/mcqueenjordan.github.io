I care a lot about high-quality audio. I spend most of my workday with
headphones on, and [music is an important tool to help keep me
focused](/thought/flow-playlist). I researched extensively for the best
headphones in the world, with these criteria in mind:

- minimal [sound leakage][leakage] (sound that leaves the headphones)
- highest-caliber sound-stage and audio possible
- durable, reliable, built to last

Given those requirements, in my research, I began to found a trend: the [Audeze
LCD-XC][amzn]. These are expensive headphones, no doubt. But I rationalized it
due to the amount of time I spend with headphones on my head.

Don't just take it from me, though. Take a look at these resources I uncovered
that convinced me that the [Audeze LCD-XC Headphones][amzn] were the best
choice:

- Read [this entire head-fi forum thread with user impressions][forum]
- Saw [Headphonia's expert review][headphonia] of the LCD-XCs
- [Read the pro-audiophile reviews on HeadFi][headfi-reviews]

This is just the tip of the iceberg of research that I did, after I narrowed
my search to 3 models fitting my use-case: Uncompromising sound quality and
build, minimal sound leakage, durable, reliable.

After several months, I can confidently say that these headphones not only blow
my high-end Sennheiser's out of the water, but their sound isolation and utter
lack of leakage is exactly what I needed. And, unlike some high-end Denon cans
I've owned in the past, these are sturdy and well-built.
