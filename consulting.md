Please email me at [jordan@whoami.sh][email] about consulting inquiries.

I've worked at the largest companies at the world, at the greatest scale of
technical engineering, and I've been among the first engineers at the smallest
of startups. I have a broad, generalist skillset, but I haven't sacrificed any
depth. My favorite types of projects usually include: foundational & early
engineering and design, planet-scale web services, distributed systems, scaling
systems, and fixing broken things.
