* Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good.
* Not launches, but landings. Apollo 11. Eagle.
* Leadership decisions -- blinders? key trade-offs? intentional decisions.
* Telling stories -- tell them what you're going to tell them; tell them; tell
  them what you've told them
* Pattern: Asking Questions (coaching)
** Who? Where? When? Why? How?
** Reflecting Qs: What I hear you saying is... It sounds like... I sense that...
** Exploring: What do you want? What will you have? What's possible? What's your
desired outcome? What's important to you?
*** Probing: What are you learning? What are you unwilling to change? What is at
risk? What is confusing you? What does the org need from you? What motivates
you? How does this relate to your longterm goals? What alternatives do you have?
How might you approach this differently? What are you assuming?
** Accountability: What will you do? What are the next steps? How will you know
if you've succeeded? What kind of accountability do you have? When will you do
it? Where do you think this will lead? What is your conclusion?
